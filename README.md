# D42-Computational-Geometry

Project for course "D42:Computational Geometry", UoA 2024

# General Information
This project explores fundamental algorithms in Computational Geometry through Python implementations and visualizations. It covers key concepts such as Convex Hulls, Linear Programming, Voronoi Diagrams, Delaunay Triangulations, and Orthogonal Range Search. The notebook provides detailed explanations of each algorithm, their implementation, and includes graphical representations to aid understanding. Performance comparisons of different Convex Hull algorithms are also presented, along with a step-by-step visualization of the Range Tree construction. This work serves as a comprehensive guide and implementation resource for core topics in Computational Geometry.
